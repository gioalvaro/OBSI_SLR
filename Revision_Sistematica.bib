A specific need within the enterprise could not be satisfied only because of a lack of awareness about real competencies owned by employees. The aforementioned problem involves two main critical aspects: the difficulty to manage employees' competencies in order to constantly keep them up-to-date and the ability to agilely share employees' profiles across the organization in order to support competency finding. This work proposes an approach to relax the above critical points by integrating a semantic web-based educational system within a social network system applied to the enterprise context. The integration glue is provided by using and harmonizing several existing upper ontologies also furthering semantic interoperability. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Within the context of automated assembly systems, one of the challenges is ensuring that machine program logic is consistent with process planning requirements. A critical inconsistency can arise due to a lack of i) formal engineering tools and methods that link the Process and Resource domains, ii) a standard way to describe the assembly process that maintains a consistent level of granularity, and iii) transparency of the machine program logic from the perspective of the Process domain. This research demonstrates how these problems can be addressed through the use of a Product, Process, Resource (PPR) ontology. The ontology model includes a Skill model that integrates the PPR domains. Due to this, the Process can be described at many levels of granularity and, provided it is linked to the Skill model, the logical sequence relative to the machine can be validated. The approach is tested on a hydrogen fuel cell assembly system where the process is described in two different ways. Nevertheless, the query is still able to ascertain the sequence consistency and execute a check for capability. The impact of this research is to enable more effective communication between domain models and an extensible Skill model that, with implementation into industrial engineering tools, will reduce costs, time-to-market, and increase responsiveness as errors in the engineering change process are mitigated.},

abstract = {Ontologies are helpful in giving interoperable structures to sources of knowledge and information. This interoperability, however, is greatly hindered by the heterogeneity of independently developed ontologies which in turn increases the requirements for mediation systems to reconcile the differences. A core concepts ontology for a certain domain contained by a foundation ontology can be used to alleviate this problem and to facilitate the reconciliation efforts. Possible differences in the use of concepts from the core concepts to model entities in domain ontologies can be prevented by binding the domain ontology developers to some rules. These rules can be particularly useful for domain ontologies requiring some kind of traceability of their concepts in the foundation ontology. The mediation system can then use this traceability to establish similarities between two ontologies. Software applications, like the one explained in this paper, can then be developed to perform the mediation task automatically and accurately.},

abstract = {The representation and management of product lifecycle information is critical to any manufacturing organization. Different modeling languages are used at different lifecycle stages, for example STEP's EXPRESS may be used at a detailed design stage, while UML may be used for initial design stages. It is necessary to consolidate product information created using these different languages to build a coherent knowledge base. In this paper, we present an approach to enable the translation of STEP schema and its instances to Ontology Web Language (OWL). This gives a modelwhich we call OntoSTEPthat can easily be integrated with any OWL ontologies to create a semantically rich model. As an example, we combine geometry information represented in STEP with non-geometry information, such as function and behavior, represented using the NIST's Core Product Model (CPM). A plug-in for Prot??g?? is developed to automate the different steps of the translation. As additional benefits, reasoning, inference procedures, and queries can be performed on enriched legacy CAD models. We describe the rules for the translation from EXPRESS to OWL, and illustrate the benefits of OWL translation with an example. We will also describe how these mapping rules can be implemented through meta-model based transformations, which can be used to map other languages to OWL.},

Translating an information structure based on a modeling paradigm and language representation will always have issues in terms of concepts mismatch and loss in translation, but even with this problem, translating entities defined in EXPRESS to concepts in OWL provides a mechanism for exploiting the rigor of OWL. The OntoSTEP explained in this paper is a step toward semantically enriching product information. OntoSTEP can easily be integrated with other OWL ontologies, such as other product models or public ontologies.},

In order to improve the consistency of the whole system design and the related data and information, knowledge crossing the expertises must be tracked and formalized regarding a shared reference. That means that instead of defining a large reference models to which each expert refers to, a light collaborative model is defined enabling to connect data from each expert model to adhoc data from other expert models, following the least commitment principle. In this topic, a new meta-model is proposed in a Model-Driven Engineering approach to manage the integration of heterogeneous experts' knowledge models in a collaborative process. The structure of the proposed knowledge meta-model is defined taking into account the complexity of knowledge definition and the properties of its components. This meta-model is split in a meta-model of data on one hand and a Collaboration Meta-Model in the other hand, to represent the distinction between the core concepts of knowledge and additional elements serving to represent the relation between these concepts, and between concepts of heterogeneous experts' models. The proposed meta-model is illustrated on an industrial case study to highlight the way to put it in use, and its interests to enable collaboration between experts throughout the design process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their semantics is typically ambiguous, causing miscommunication between modelers and unexpected implementation results. This article introduces a way to disambiguate common flow modeling constructs, by expressing their semantics as constraints on runtime sequences of behavior execution. It also shows that reduced ambiguity enables more powerful modeling abstractions, such as partial behavior specifications.

The taxonomy, the core of an ontology, is a delicate balance between adequacy considerations, minimal commitments and implementation concerns. However, ontological taxonomies can be quite restrictive and entities that are commonly used in production and services might not find room in a official or de facto standard or ontological system. This mismatch between the company's view and the ontological constraints can limit or even jeoparize the adoption of modern formal ontologies in industry. We study the roots of this problem and individuate a general set of principles to relate the ontology and those non-ontological entities that are yet important for the core business of the company. We then introduce a theoretically sound and formally robust approach to expand a given ontology with new dependency relations, which make available information regarding the non-ontological entities without affecting the consistency of the overall information system.},

abstract = {Environmental Sustainability is one of the ‘Grand Challenges' for manufacturing success in the 21st century. The present article mainly focuses on energy use during the manufacturing steps used for assembling products. In particular, industry still needs systematic and reliable ways to capture information for ultimately accounting for energy efficiency in manufacturing processes. For that purpose, an information model in the form of a formal ontology was created using information elements as building blocks, which emerge from manufacturing process models, supply chain operations, manufacturing process parameters, 3D form features and exergy-based thermodynamic analysis. These information elements were integrated by means of semantic relationships in an ontology. Once this information model was constructed, an application example of a welded hull panel assembly was used for verification of the model's representativeness and completeness. Results show that it is feasible to correlate all required data by means of semantic relationships for estimating energy efficiency indicators prior to physical prototyping, or ultimately comparing different alternatives for manufacturing processes regarding energy efficiency. However, manufacturing processes must be described in detail in order to allow energy efficiency analyses. In addition, geometric models need to be able to represent form features that can best relate to specific manufacturing process parameters. And finally, energy efficiency indicators, such as the degree-of-perfection can be derived from a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis, to be performed in each individual process step. Results indicate it is possible to provide an information structure for the calculation of the degree-of- perfection associated with an exergy-based thermodynamic analysis in assembly processes. Therefore, it has the potential to serve as a basis for a unifying framework for developing software applications that could allow the calculation of the degree of perfection in manufacturing operations. In addition, the resulting information model may facilitate data integration in the extended enterprise environment as well as the development of standards that can lead to seamless interoperability of manufacturing information systems. This paper presents the means by which energy efficiency can be accessed directly from an integrated semantic model, and opens the possibility to be extended for many different sorts of manufacturing processes.},

abstract = {The present capability that ontological approaches offer to formally represent and share manufacturing knowledge is dependent on the choice of ontological formalism. Currently, there exists a spectrum of these formalisms, which is being subjectively exploited across multiple domains in design and manufacture. Hence, there is an important prerequisite to achieve an understanding of which family of formalism strictly enables the expressive capture of semantics to progress towards meaningful information and viable knowledge sharing. This article analyses the relative strengths and weaknesses in employing a 'lightweight' ontology versus a 'heavyweight' version of the ontology to represent and share knowledge between multiple domains in injection moulding design and manufacture. A pertinent direction, from an ontology perspective, is then exposed as a prescription for the improved capture and dissemination of formal semantics, to support multi-domain knowledge sharing. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Production-centric international standards are intended to serve as an important route towards information sharing across manufacturing decision support systems. As a consequence of the textual-based definitions of the concepts acknowledged within these standards, their inability to fully interoperate becomes an issue, especially since a multitude of standards are required to cover the needs of extensive domains such as manufacturing industries. To help reinforce the current understanding to support the consolidation of production-centric standards for improved information sharing, this article explores the specification of well-defined core concepts that can be used as a basis for capturing tailored semantic definitions. The potentials of two heavyweight ontological approaches, notably Common Logic (CL) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL), as candidates for the task are also explored. An important finding regarding these two methods is that while an OWL-based approach shows capabilities towards applications that may require flexible hierarchies of concepts, a CL-based method represents a favoured contender for scoped and facts-driven manufacturing applications. 1. Introduction The ISO (International Standardisation Organisation) community is responsible for the development and dissemination of shared best practices related to a wide range of subject areas. Of particular relevance to the field of information and knowledge sharing in product design and manufacture is ISO Technical Committee 184 (ISO TC184). The standards developed within their Sub-Committees (SCs) contribute to the establishment of a framework for exchanging product lifecycle information, with the additional benefit of promoting interoperability across manufacturing applications. However, in several instances, concept terms and definitions acknowledged in standards remain largely textual in nature (Michel 2005, Gunendran et al. 2007, Young et al. 2007) and are, therefore, liable to subjective interpretation. Furthermore, it is not always obvious how certain concepts, supposed to be coherent across standards, are consistent with one another (Usman et al. 2010). These issues imply that, although standards can be of considerable advantage in relatively confined domains where their common interpretation is guaranteed, they nevertheless fall short of meeting seamless information exchanges across larger manufacturing domains. This is because larger domains require a spectrum of standards for satisfying all relevant manufacturing-driven activities and this also involves groups that may jointly function within institutional boundaries as well as across multiple organisations (Hameed et al. 2004). Hence, there is a need for consolidating the meaning of concept terms and definitions across production-centric standards. Ontological approaches, which are a subset of technologies for information and knowledge support (Chandra and Kamrani 2003), are presently offering a step towards consolidating shared meaning in computational form. Several researchers such as Kim et al. (2006), Costa et al. (2007) and Lin et al. (2011) have pursued ontology-based understandings to resolve a range of semantics and knowledge-related issues in product design and manufacture. One important observation is that a majority of related work tends to exploit the Web Ontology Language (OWL)},

abstract = {Product lifecycle management provides a framework for information sharing that promotes various types of decision-making procedures. For product lifecycle management to advance towards knowledge-driven decision support, then this demands more than simply exchanging information. There is, therefore, a need to formally capture best practice through-life engineering knowledge that can be fed back across the product lifecycle. This article investigates the interoperable manufacturing knowledge systems concept. Interoperable manufacturing knowledge systems use an expressive ontological approach that drives the improved configuration of product lifecycle management systems for manufacturing knowledge sharing. An ontology of relevant core product lifecycle concepts is identified from which viewpoint-specific domains, such as design and manufacture, can be formalised. Essential ontology-based mechanisms are accommodated to support the verification and sharing of manufacturing knowledge across domains. The work has been experimentally assessed using an aerospace compressor disc design and manufacture example. While it has been demonstrated that the approach supports the representation of disparate design and manufacture perspectives as well as manufacturing knowledge feedback in a timely manner, areas for improvement have also been identified for future work. {\textcopyright} 2012 IMechE.},

IMKS 
muestra el diagrama con los terminos importantes en uml
The adoption of methods similar to the IMKS approach shall provide an imminent positive impact on the way that multiple product lifecycle applications interact for delivering knowledge sharing capability at the right place and time. However, it should not be forgotten that there exists
a number of areas that deserve further attention, e.g. change management of current information-driven sys- tems into knowledge-driven systems, ontology manage- ment, knowledge maintenance and through-life engineering knowledge feedback. Opportunities are also present for extending the current manufacturing core ontology into a much richer model with structures to capture, e.g. assembly, shop-floor and service, knowledge. Finally, based on the understanding displayed in this
work, it is possible to extrapolate that there are two main directions for further exploiting the IMKS approach. First, it can be utilised as a short term solu- tion, targeting an incremental improvement that sup- plements existing PLM systems with an expressive ontological basis to provide meaning to PLM concepts and to harvest the benefits of semantic definitions and rule-bases.

abstract = {The requirements for the interoperability of semantics and knowledge have become increasingly important in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), in the drive towards knowledge-driven decision support in the manufacturing industry. This article presents a novel concept, based on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The concept has been implemented under the Interoperable Manufacturing Knowledge Systems (IMKS) project in order to understand the extent to which manufacturing system interoperability can be supported using radically new methods of knowledge sharing. The concept exploits the capabilities of semantically well-defined core concepts formalised in a Common Logic-based ontology language. The core semantics can be specialised to configure multiple application-specific knowledge bases, as well as product and manufacturing information platforms. Furthermore, the utilisation of the expressive ontology language and the generic nature of core concepts help support the specification of system mechanisms to enable the verification of knowledge across multiple platforms. An experimental demonstration, using a test case based on the design and manufacture of an aerospace part, has been realised. This has led to the identification of several benefits of the approach, its current limitations as well as the areas to be considered for further work. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The ongoing sophistication in costumer's needs have increased the complexity in the Integrated Product Development Process (IPDP). This remarkable growth demands that systems offer support to many different stages of IPDP, going across early planning and practical development phases. Concurrently, the level of detail and quantity of information are exponentially growing in this applications. However, there was also an increase in the number of semantic obstacles to sharing information across systems. These semantic obstacles are mainly related to the heterogenic nature of the information, which has its captured meaning interpreted in a divergent way, increasing the project costs and development time. In this context, this article contributes to the development of the core ontologies from the Reference View, to aid the semantic interoperability in the Product Design stage, further improving the exchange of information during different phases of the IPDP. The core ontologies research is focused on supporting the development of a plastic injected product, gathering and sharing information across the domains of part and mould design, mould manufacture and materials selection. The experimental system has demonstrated the potential to aid the exchange of information and inconsistency analysis in the Integrated Product Development Process. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This article exposes a solution to ensure Closed-Loop Manufacturing from CNC machines to CAM systems. The main goal is to capitalize knowledge from the CNC machine and to reuse it in the CAM system. This proposal aims to help CAM programmers in making choices for planning new machining sequences. The STEP-NC standard allows bi-directional exchanges in the digital chain-from CAD systems to CNC machines. Unfortunately, STEP-NC standard does not allow having a traceability of machining program. To achieve the information feedback from CNC machine to CAM system, Closed-Loop Manufacturing sets up a manufacturing loop using PLM systems. This solution is based on OntoSTEP-NC, an ontology based on STEP-NC which provides trades between Product Data Management, Manufacturing Process Management and Enterprise Resource Planning. As a solution OntoSTEP-NC supports data extraction from CNC machines, and relevant information reinjection to CAM systems. Closed-Loop Manufacturing is a three steps process: (1) Manufacturing feature recognition to have the most relevant information reinjection from the Manufacturing Process Management database in the CAM programming stage, (2) validation of machining sequences before capitalizing them, (3) capitalization of cutting parameters, the manufacturing feature and the material to fill the Manufacturing Process Management database. This process will help CAM programmers making choices for cutting conditions based on company good practices. A case study has been chosen to test Closed-Loop Manufacturing concepts. The case study is divided into three scenarios aiming at testing first the "reuse phase" including manufacturing feature recognition for the reinjection of relevant information. The third scenario tests the "capitalization phase" and the ability of the system to detect the changes made by the operator directly on the CNC machine. This paper also details the trades between the CAM systems and OntoSTEP-NC by focusing on extracted data and the way the information is capitalized into the Manufacturing Process Management database. It also details the queries addressed to the Manufacturing Process Management database to send the most relevant information.},

abstract = {Software vendors offer a portfolio of applications that can be integrated with each other to form product lifecycle management systems (PLMS). Such systems are implemented to create an integrated product information environment. Product information can take the form of relational data, electronic documents, or both. However, implemented PLMS do not have the same capability to handle product information at the product relational data level and the document level. Due to limited resources, many Small and Medium-size Enterprises (SMEs) have only one PLM application supporting the NPD process at one of these levels. Information needs not met by this PLM application are managed more or less efficiently by complementary means. Which PLM application type should a SME use to start implementing a PLMS? In this article, we make eight proposals distinguishing document-oriented PLM applications and relational data-oriented PLM applications to help practitioners choose and implement the PLM application best suited to their company's needs. These proposals are illustrated by the comparison of two real cases: one document-oriented and the other relational data-oriented. Overall, this article deals with the complementarity of document management and product relational data management to meet PLM issues in most SMEs.},

abstract = {Technologies of 3G and beyond open up new opportunities to develop and commercialize context-aware services that utilize information like user location and social context. Although initial expectations were high, the adoption and diffusion of context-aware services have thus far been limited. Existing literature points to failing business models to explain part of the disappointing uptake. However, most authors focus on the factors that explain failing business models rather than providing practical design issues to improve business model viability. This paper fills this gap by specifying generic mobile business model design issues for the domain of context-aware services. As such, we provide a well-grounded, holistic overview of design issues that are the most critical in developing viable business models for context-aware services, based on interviews with eighteen esteemed practitioners and academics in the mobile services domain, at CEO and Professor level. Our findings indicate key challenges in the service domain (i.e. defining value adding elements, specifying target groups and generating trust of consumers in the service), the technology domain (i.e. integrating emerging technology platforms and safeguarding privacy and security), the organizational domain (i.e. division of existing and new roles in complex value networks, openness of the value network towards new service providers and governing the activities in the value network) and the financial domain (i.e. pricing; dividing costs and revenues and combining multiple revenue models). Our research has scientific implications, because it applies generic mobile business model theory to the context-aware services domain. In addition, we provide practical clues to practitioners with regard to the design issues on which they should focus while developing more viable context-aware business models.

The second grand challenge for the MSEE project is to transform current manufacturing hierarchical supply chains into manufacturing open ecosystems, i.e. on the one side to define and implement business processes and policies to support collaborative innovation in a secure industrial environment and, on the other side, to define a new collaborative architecture for ESA (Enterprise Software and Applications), to support business-IT interaction and distributed decision making in virtual factories and enterprises. The synthesis of the two grand challenges above in industrial business scenarios and their full adoption in European test cases will result in new Virtual Factory Industrial Models, where service orientation and collaborative innovation will support a new renaissance of Europe in the global manufacturing context. The MSEE system will be implemented by an ecosystem of models and services distributed at the level of: i) the single manufacturing enterprise, ii) its value network and business ecosystem and iii) the ‘Future Internet' of knowledge models and services. Alignment of the distributed heterogeneous enterprise models, as well as interoperability of the relevant applicative and utility services will be the two main technical challenges of the project.},

Yet, what is ontology? What challenges have been addressed so far? What role does ontology play? Do we really need ontology? These are the core questions this paper seeks to address. We propose to conduct a comprehensive study of the concept of Ontology firstly in its domain of origin, Philosophy, and secondly in information science. Based on the understanding of this concept and an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, seven key roles of ontology are defined. These roles serve as a framework describing the general state of research on the use of ontologies in the context of PLM. 1. Introduction Product lifecycle management (PLM) is defined as a concept for the integrated management of product-related informa-tion through the entire product lifecycle (Saaksvuori and Immonen 2004). This vision is enabled by recent advances on information and communication technologies and is needed to support current industry needs for faster innovation cycles combined with lower costs (Schuh et al. 2008). PLM involves several challenges, one of these challenges consists of the integration of multiple software solutions (Schuh et al. 2008), namely enterprise resource planning (ERP), product data management (PDM), customer relationship management (CRM) and other CAx systems (Computer-aided Design, Computer-aided Manufacturing or Computer-aided Process Planning). The aim of this integration was to overcome the existing organisational barriers and to streamline the value creation chain. Two main types of integration can be distin-guished in general: integration of functionalities and integration of data (Kermanshahani 2009). Function integration deals with the problem of making local functions from disparate systems available in a uniform manner (Leymann and Roller 2002). Data integration implies an access to data in heterogeneous and autonomous data sources via a homoge-neous interface. The most known function-based integration approaches are application integration frameworks and workflow systems, such as the works of Bertoni et al. (2009), Marchetta, Mayer, and Forradellas (2011), OMG (2011), Schuh et al. (2008), and Srinivasan (2011). Function-based integration approaches reach their limit in dynamic environ-ments and when numerous external systems, processes and data sources need to be integrated (Haas, Lin, and Roth 2002). In a data-based integration approach, data from different sources are integrated into a global integrated schema (Kermanshahani 2009). One of the most important issues for data-oriented integration approaches is semantic interoper-ability (Hakimpour and Geppert 2001; Kermanshahani 2009). In addition to providing an integrated and holistic view on data across the full product lifecycle, PLM raises other challenges in terms of:},
annote = {En la introduccion define plm, luego plm trae asociado multiples conflictos, la integracion. Existen dos tipos de integraciones basadas en funciones y en datos. Luego define ambas y pone ejemplos en ambas, dice que la de funciones tiene su limites por el ambiente dinamico y habla que la interoperabilidad semantica forma parte de las orientadas a datos.

Este paper presenta un estado del arte que estudia los problemas de integracion de los sistemas PLM. Remarca los objetivos de las ontologias en este contexto y las limitaciones de las soluciones existentes basadas en ontologias. Como asi tambien los roles que juegan estas soluciones que no estan exclusivamente relacionadas con el problema de integracion de los sistemas.

Los objetivos de las ontologias en este context de integracion de los sistemas plm son: 
- Las ontologias proveen una estructura de entidades, sus propiedades, relaciones y axiomas que describen un dominio especifico.
- En este {\'{a}}mbito espec{\'{i}}fico, la estructuraci{\'{o}}n queda totalmente determinada, independientemente de los requisitos de cualquier sistema o de los requisitos cambiantes de un sistema determinado. (no suena a objetivo)
- Las ontologias capturan el dominio de las entidades y la informacion relacionada en diferentes niveles enfocandose en la granularidad.
- Las ontologias actuan como punto de referencia para los dise{\~{n}}os para extraer especificaciones de sistemas

Las limitaciones de los productos de ontologias existentes son:
Falta de harmonisacion y normalizacion 
Falta de expresividad
Falta de completitus

los roles que describe son: 
-Fuente confiable de conocimiento
-Base de datos
- Base de conocimiento
- Puente entre multiple dominios
- Mediador para interoperabilidad
-Buscador contextual
- Habilitador de Linked data

Table 1. Four fundamental objectives of ontology. Objective 1
Objective 2 Objective 3
Objective 4 Ontology provides a structuring of entities, their properties, relations and axioms describing a specific domain
In this specific domain, the structuring remains entirely determinate regardless of the requirements of any system or of the changing requirements of a given system
Ontology captures domain entities and related information at different levels of focus and granularity Ontology acts as a point of reference for designers to extract system specification

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach called IfcView that relies on Semantic Web technologies for creating building views. To do so, we consider an ifcOWL ontology proposed by buildingSMART. The ifcOWL is an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) based ontology. By combining the ifcOWL ontology with logical rules (expressed in Semantic Web Rule Language, SWRL), we demonstrate through several case studies that our approach can perform a more intuitive and flexible extraction of building views when compared to the Model View Definition (MVD) approach. This is because our rule-based approach dynamically creates sub-graphs (i.e. views) by specifying the IFC elements to extract as Globally Unique Identifiers (GUID), relationships or entities. Another benefit of our approach is the fact that it simplifies the maintenance and definition of building views. Once our rule-based system extracts such a building view (i.e. sub-graph), this view can be exported by using STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product) or Turtle (a Resource Description Framework (RDF) syntax) formats.},

Therefore, a unified information base for the whole building and its components and technical equipment is highly beneficial. One approach aiming at this goal is Building Information Modelling (BIM). There exist standards mostly focusing on architectural and building physical properties, like the Green Building XML schema (gbXML). A further improvement would be to include a description of the technical equipment and building automation components as well, and to make the resulting model accessible in a unified way. This paper aims at a holistic knowledge base for buildings providing views on static building and automation systems configuration as well as runtime information, i.e., access to live values of datapoint originating in the building automation systems.

Globalization impacts on the competitive capacity of industries forcing them to integrate their productive processes with other facilities geographically distributed. So, information systems supporting such processes should interoperate. Standards have been seen for many years as a way to reach interoperability. In particular, the committee 184 subcommittee 4 of the International Standard Organization (ISO) focus on the definition of industrial product data standards. However, they still suffer from semantic inconsistencies when the standards are put to work together. In this article, we propose an ontology network as a semantic bridge among standards for product representation, as a solution to reach interoperability among information system in manufacturing industries.},

abstract = {With the rapid popularity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology, BIM resources such as building product libraries are growing rapidly on the World Wide Web. As a result, this also increases the difficulty for quickly finding useful BIM resources that are sufficiently close to user's specific needs. Keyword-based search methods have been widely used due to their ease of use, but their search accuracy is often not satisfactory because of the semantic ambiguity of terminologies in BIM-specific documents and queries. To address this issue, we develop a prototype semantic search engine, named BIMSeek, for retrieving online BIM resources. The central work consists of two parts as follows. Firstly, based on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which is a major standard for BIM, a domain ontology is constructed for encoding BIM-specific knowledge into the search engine. Using the ontology, term'inologies in BIM documents can be disambiguated and indexed. Secondly, by combining the ontology and local context analysis technique, an automatic query expansion method is presented for improving retrieval performance. Compared with traditional keyword-based methods and WordNet-based query expansion methods, the experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms them. The search engine is available at http://cgcad.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/liuyushen/ifcqe/.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 standards, such as AutomationML, are used to specify properties of mechatronic elements in terms of views, such as the electrical and mechanical views of a motor engine. These views have to be integrated in order to obtain a complete model. Currently, the integration requires user knowledge to manually identify elements in the views that refer to the same element in a final integrated model. Existing approaches are not able to scale up to large mod- els where a potentially large number of conflicts may exist across the different views of an element. To overcome this limitation, we developed ALLIGATOR, a deductive rule-based system able to identify conflicts among AutomationML documents. We define a Datalog-based representation of the AutomationML in- put documents, and a set of rules for identifying conflicts. A deductive engine is used to resolve the conflicts, to merge the input documents and produce an integrated AutomationML document. Our empirical evaluation of the quality of ALLIGATOR against a benchmark of AutomationML documents suggest that ALLIGATOR accurately identifies various types of conflicts between AutomationML documents, and thus helps increasing the scalability, efficiency, and coherence of models for Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments.},

abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse — definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects — is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

However, providing a reusable source of manufacturing best practice is difficult due to the complexity of the viewpoint relationships between products and the manufacturing processes and resources used to produce them. This paper discusses how best to organise manufacturing best practice knowledge, the relationships between elements of this knowledge plus their relationship to product information. The paper also explores the application of UML-2 as a system design tool which can model these relationships and hence support the reuse of system design models over time. The paper identifies a set of part family and feature libraries and, most significantly, the relationships between them, as a means of capturing best practice manufacturing knowledge and illustrates how these can be linked to manufacturing resource models and product information. Design for manufacture and machining best practice views are used in the paper to illustrate the concepts developed.

Powerful software tools are utilized by each individual discipline, but it remains challenging to connect these into tool chains for increased efficiency. To support this endeavour, the literature on interoperability assessment was surveyed to identify concepts valuable to transfer from the interoperability to the tool integration research field. Implementation options, types of interoperability and domains described in interoperability assessment models were concepts identified as directly transferable. To avoid the problems with uptake that plague the models identified, visual analytics is suggested as a vehicle for the transfer. Furthermore, based on the use of non-functional properties as an underlying motivation for these models, cost, performance and sustainability are suggested as a common base for future research in both discourses.},

abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have been increasingly used to support the decision making in manufacturing organizations however they lack the ability to fully support the capture and sharing of specific domain knowledge across multiple domains. The ability of ICT based systems to share knowledge is impeded by the semantic conflicts arising from loosely defined meanings and intents of the participating concepts. This research work exploits the concept of formal ontologies to rigorously define the semantics of domain concepts to support knowledge sharing within the assembly domain. In this thesis, a novel research framework has been proposed in the form of a assembly reference ontology which can provide a common semantic base to support knowledge sharing across the assembly design and assembly process planning domains. The framework consists of a set of key reference concepts identified to represent the assembly domain related knowledge. These concepts have been specialized from the most generic level to the most specialized level and have been formally defined to support the capture and sharing of assembly knowledge. The proposed framework also supports the creation of application specific ontologies by providing them with a common semantic base. The research concept has been experimentally investigated by using a selected set of assembly reference concepts which have been used to formally represent and relate assembly design and assembly process planning knowledge. The results of the experiments verify that the implemented ontology facilitates the system to understand the semantics of concepts and supports knowledge sharing across the assembly design and assembly process planning domains. The experimental results also show that the proposed framework can also support the development of a range of application specific ontologies.},

abstract = {The role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is crucial for future manufacturing organisations in order to support effective collaboration and information sharing. However, the contemporary ICT-based systems lack the required ability to adequately support interoperability across multiple domain systems. The capability of such ICT-based systems to interoperate is impeded by the semantic conflicts arising from loosely defined meanings and intents of the participating system concepts. The aim of this paper is to investigate the interoperability of assembly systems at multiple levels of concept specialisations using the concept of a formal reference ontology. Formal ontologies are providing a promising way to computationally capture the domain meanings which can subsequently provide a base to support interoperability across multiple systems and in our case multiple assembly systems. This paper takes the example of manufacturing bill of materials concept and three different domain-specific interpretations to explore and demonstrate the potential of formal reference ontologies to support interoperability.},

abstract = {Aimed at the requirements of knowledge representation and integration in product lifecycle, a framework of product knowledge integration based on middle-layer was proposed. Using the techniques of ontology, the framework has the abilities of explicit definition of semantics, uniform representation and dynamic integration of product knowledge. In the meta-ontology layer, relationship primitives in ontology are defined to provide a generic representation method of ontology. In the ontology layer, meta-ontology is extended to share ontology, domain ontology, process ontology and application ontology to support the collaborative definition and the integrated mapping of ontology. In the knowledge layer, corresponding logical structures are provided for the structured and standardized management of knowledge instances, and the methods of using Web ontology language (OWL) for formal representation are given. The application of a shock absorber demonstrated that the approach can improve the product data management (PDM) system of integrating knowledge.},

This study used webpage technology, combined with ontology, computer-aided design (CAD) secondary development tools and knowledge management, to construct the knowledge classification of the historical knowledge platform of plastic injection products. Meanwhile, by recording relevant product information and issues encountered in design, this study achieved standardisation and knowledge to facilitate the design, manufacturing and testing of moulds through the mould design navigating process. Valuable hand-on knowledge in the design process was accumulated to provide knowledge assistance in follow-up product and mould designs, preventing costs from improper designs and in this case effectively shortening design time by 26{\%}. Also, the historical knowledge platform can be applied in various design stages of plastic injection moulding products. This integration could considerably improve and optimise the production efficiency of the mould industry. The proposed knowledge platform in this study could better meet the urgent needs of the mould industry, and bring competitive advantages to enterprises. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Supplying readers with a clear understanding of empirical software engineering best practices, it provides up-to-date guidance on how to conduct secondary studies in software engineering--replacing the existing 2004 and 2007 technical reports. The book is divided into three parts. The first part discusses the nature of evidence and the evidence-based practices centered on a systematic review, both in general and as applying to software engineering. The second part examines the different elements that provide inputs to a systematic review (usually considered as forming a secondary study), especially the main forms of primary empirical study currently used in software engineering. The final part provides practical guidance on how to conduct systematic reviews (the guidelines), drawing together accumulated experiences to guide researchers and students in planning and conducting their own studies.

This paper proposes a multilevel product modeling framework enabling stakeholders to define product models and relate them to physical or simulated instances. The framework is defined within the Model-Driven Architecture using the multilevel (data, model, metamodel) approach. The data level represents real-world products, the model level describes models (product models) of real-world products, and the metamodel level describes models of the product models. The metamodel defined in this paper is specialized from a web ontology language enabling product designers to express the semantics of product models in an engineering-friendly way. The interactions between these three levels are described to show how each level in the framework is used in a product engineering context.

abstract = {Each domain industry requires the detailed specifications for sharing and exchanging building information models throughout the design, construction, and operation phases. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) Model View Definitions (MVDs) specify required information for exchanges of building model data among building project experts. The data involves the identification of model semantics shared by two or more applications. However, since no robust standard for defining building semantics and requirements for data exchange has been agreed upon, information embedded in domain-specific MVDs are generated separately and are vague in scope, which results in a lack of consistency. In addition, the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) that includes exchange specifications needed for each exchange process of a product model is manually defined in a paper-based document. Because there is no clear logical link between the units of information in the exchange requirements of an IDM, and those of MVDs, the mapping that translates requirements of an IDM into ones of an MVD is open to various interpretation, without semantic and logical consistency. Such challenges might result in redundant requirements and rules for data exchange that are not supposed to be handled in the process of MVDs. To ameliorate this situation, this research proposes the new approach of formalizing domain knowledge and defining accurate data modules for model views. To achieve this goal, the authors employed ontological principles for generating an IDM for the precast concrete domain and for linking its MVD with formal information models. The formalized structure of domain knowledge is expected to support defining explicit data modules and developing manageable relationships among entities using semantic reasoning so that domain professionals and software vendors can identify the intents of the requirements of mapped MVDs and keep track of mapping problems. Moreover, to integrate IDM and MVD development processes, the ontology-based IDM is parsed and translated from OWL/XML to mvdXML, which automatically generates MVD documentation in the IfcDoc tool.},

RQ1: How much research activity on the field of EO has there been since 2007?
RQ2: What research topics are being investigated? 
RQ3: What research approaches are being used? 
RQ4: What applications are seen for EOs?
RQ5: Which topics regarding EO need further research according to the authors?
The concept of an Enterprise Ontology (EO) has received some attention in the last years. Many papers have been published that show EOs as a tool for enterprise development. Benefits generated with the help of EO, can be direct savings (Gailly and Poels, 2009; Wautelet et al.,1998;Sunkle et al., 2013) or an increase of business process efficiency (Guangwen and Hu, 2009; Moura et al., 2010) for example.
An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization (Gruber, 1995). The ontology includes definitions of concepts and an indication of how concepts are inter-related which collectively impose a structure on the domain and constrain the possible interpretations of terms (Uschold, 1995) . The ontology is used to improve communication between either humans or computers. In the concrete, the ontology is used to assist in communication between human agents, to achieve interoperability among computer systems, or to improve the process and/or quality of engineering software systems (Jasper and Uschold, 1999). The combination of the computer systems of an enterprise, their connections to each other and the related exchange of information can be seen as the Enterprise Architecture (EA) (Stelzer 2010; Hanschke 2009; Meyer and Birs{\"{o}}z, 2009; Rosauer et al., 2004; Feldschmid, 2009) . Therefore, if the Enterprise Architecture is defined in an ontology, communication problems in EA related tasks can be reduced. Ontologies provide a tool for communication and for formalization},

Smart manufacturing refers to integrating new generation information technologies and advanced manufacturing technologies to improve enterprise efficiency, increase customer satisfaction and enhance market competitiveness. Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is a typical paradigm of smart manufacturing. With the rapid deployment and application of various CMfg systems, it is extremely urgent and significant to implement the standardized semantic description of manufacturing resources (MRs) characterized by geographical dispersion, high autonomy, and heterogeneity. In this paper, a metadata based manufacturing resource ontology modeling method is proposed to solve the consistency description problem of MRs in cloud. Firstly, the characteristic attributes of MRs in CMfg systems are analyzed, and a metadata-based manufacturing resource ontology-modeling framework is constructed. Then, a manufacturing resource domain ontology (MR{\_}Onto) and a metadata model (MR{\_}Meta) are designed, the mapping rules between them are discussed.

abstract = {Product lifecycle management (PLM) is a new business strategy for enterprise's product R{\&}D. A PLM system holds and maintaining the integrity of the product data produced throughout its entire lifecycle. There is, therefore, a need to build a safe and effective product data model to support PLM system. The paper proposes a domain-based product data model for PLM. The domain modeling method is introduced, including the domain concept and its defining standard along the product evolution process. The product data model in every domain is explained, and the mapping rules among these models are discussed. Mapped successively among these models, product data can be successfully realized the dynamic evolution and the historical traceability in PLM system.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing distributed, networked and crowd-sourced cloud environment imposes the need of a service-oriented product data model for explicit representation of service requests in global manufacturing-service networks. The work in this paper aims to develop such a description framework for products based on semantic web technologies to facilitate the make-to-individual production strategy in a cloud manufacturing environment. A brief discussion on the requirements of a product data model in cloud manufacturing and research on product data modelling is given in the first part. A systematic ontology development methodology is then proposed and elaborated. The ontology called ManuService has been developed, consisting of all necessary concepts for description of products in a service-oriented business environment. These concepts include product specifications, quality constraints, manufacturing processes, organisation information, cost expectations, logistics requirements, and etcetera. ManuService ontology provides a module-based, reconfigurable, privacy-enhanced and standardised approach to modelling customised manufacturing service requests. An industrial case is presented to demonstrate possible applications using ManuService ontology. Comprehensive discussions are given thereafter, including a pilot application of a software package for semantic-based product design and a semantic web-based module for intelligent knowledge-based decision-making based on ManuService. ManuService forms the basis for collaborative service-oriented business interactions, intelligent and secure service provision in cloud manufacturing environment. {\textcopyright} 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract = {Compared with Computer Aided Design (CAD) to use computer graphics technologies to describe geometric information for the product design, many new methodologies and systems have been developed in the past decades in product modeling to extend the functions of the traditional CAD systems. In the product representation aspect, in addition to the design solution usually modeled by geometric descriptions, modeling of product knowledge has been widely investigated to describe the rationale for creation of the product solution. In the information technology aspect, in addition to the traditional computing tools such as computer programming languages and object oriented design, distributed computing technologies particularly Internet, web and cloud computing tools have been widely employed to implement product modeling systems. In the product development process aspect, in addition to the design solution, other product lifecycle aspects such as manufacturing, maintenance and service have been modeled and integrated into the same environment. In this literature review, the recent advances of research on product modeling in product representation, information technologies and product development process are investigated from these three new perspectives: knowledge, distributed computing, and product lifecycle. In addition, traditional methodologies and future challenges in computer-based product modeling are also discussed.},

based on unified schemes. Rachuri et al. [65] developed a framework for product
information interoperability to access, store, serve, and reuse the information in
the whole product lifecycle. In this framework, the Core Product Model (CPM)
and its extensions were used as the product modeling scheme. Since support of
PLM requires a set of complementary and interoperable standards that cover the
full range of product lifecycle aspects, Rachuri et al. [67] further introduced
a model of the information flows in PLM, serving as the basis for understanding
the role of standards in PLM support systems. Srinivasan [76] developed an
integrated framework considering business and technical aspects for PLM using
open standards and service-oriented architecture. (2) PLM modeling using

knowledge management platform for small to medium sized enterprises, in which
an ontological knowledge management methodology based on the semantic web
initiative data format was employed for PLM. Matsokis and Kiritsis [48]
developed an ontology-based approach for PLM. In this approach, the UML based
model was translated into an ontology model. The above PLM modeling methods,
particularly the ontology-based PLM modeling methods, provide useful tools for
implement-ing various PLM systems. As summarized by Kadiri and Kiritsis [29],
the two major problems in PLM modeling are the lack of completeness in terms of
representing middle and end of lifecycle semantics, and the lack of
harmonization and normalization of product ontologie},

abstract = {Ontologies are rapidly becoming popular in various research fields. There is a tendency both in converting existing models into ontologies and in creating new models. In this work we are focusing on Closed-Loop Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) models. An ontology model of a Product Data and Knowledge Management Semantic Object Model for PLM has been developed, with the aim of implementing ontology advantages and features into the model. An initial effort of developing the model into an ontology using Web Ontology Language-Description Logic (OWL-DL) is described in detail and the background and the motives for converting existing PLM models to ontologies is provided. The new model facilitates several of the OWL-DL capabilities, while maintaining previously achieved characteristics. Furthermore, a case study is presented based on application scenarios on the automotive industry. This case study deals with data integration and interoperability problems, in which a significant number of reasoning capabilities is implemented. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

On the other hand, these complexities are also appending up the organizational assets. The configuration of the state of art and introduction of an architecture which can convert this organizational asset into an action such as to introduce an added value in the product life cycle is an interesting but challenging task. We in this study have discussed the issues related to enterprise collaboration for the purpose of assessment of an enterprise's capability. Moreover, we have also proposed the solution for how we can utilize the structural knowledge of ontological modeling to address this issue along with the emerging technological advances. It's flexible as well as useful to utilize the state of the art digital preservation model to store, reuse and access the ontologies. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Research Questions. This SLR aims to answer the following research questions: RQ1. How have foundational ontologies been used as part of EAI approaches? RQ2. Do the studies use the ontologies at development time, at run time or both? RQ3. Do the studies follow a systematic approach for performing the integration
project? (Do they adopt or propose a method or a process model defining activities, inputs, outputs, guidelines, etc.?)

Selection Criteria. The selection criteria are organized in inclusion and exclusion criteria. There is a single inclusion criterion: 
(IC1) The study presents a semantic EAI initiative that uses foundational ontology. There are four exclusion criteria: 
(EC1) The study is not written in English; 
(EC2) The study is an older version of another study already considered; 
(EC3) The study is not a primary study (including editorials and summaries of keynotes, workshops or tutorials); and

abstract = {In the last years, attention has been devoted to the development of ontologies, which are ICT conceptual models allowing a formal and shared representation of a particular domain of discourse, and to the use of these representations in a variety of contexts, among which also the industrial engineering can be counted. Within the industrial engineering field, the manufacturing domain has not yet seen a wide application of ontologies. This paper firstly shows the use of ontologies for the semantic annotation of a Web Service-based architecture for the control of manufacturing systems; and then contributes to the research field of manufacturing domain ontologies by proposing a thorough literature review and analysis of the available languages supporting such objective. The paper collects the main requirements that semantic languages must meet to be used in the manufacturing domain with the outlined purpose. In fact, the available semantic languages are several and characterized by different features: the paper identifies the most proper ones for the manufacturing domain representation thanks to their analysis against the main requirements. Lastly, the paper shows how the discussed topics are deployed in a real industrial example.},

When designing and configuring GPN to develop, manufacture and deliver product-service provision, information requirements that affect decision making become more complex. The application of reference ontologies to a domain and its related information requirements can enhance and accelerate the development of new product-service systems with a view towards the seamless interchange of information or interoperability between systems and domains. This paper presents (i) preliminary results for the capture and modelling of end-user information, (ii) an initial higher level reference core ontology for the development of reference ontologies and (iii) the formal logical modelling of Level 1 of the FLEXINET reference ontology using a Common Logic based approach.},

In the context the FLEXINET end users there are three main business requirements that the reference ontology must support. These are (i) the rapid response to customer new business requirements, (ii) the potential business opportunities derived from the move towards product-service based business models and (iii) the potential business opportu- nities arising from the exploitation of new technologies. The second starting point has been the assessment of existing ontological research work, this being work from the Interoperable Manufacturing Knowledge Systems (IMKS) [6] project, the Manufacturing Service Ecosystem (MSEE) project [11] and the Manufacturing Information ontological model set out by Hastilow [10], they have been assessed for applicability to the GPN and PSS domains.

However, progress in support of manufacturing enterprise interoperability has tended to be limited to fairly narrow domains of applicability. This paper presents a progression of research and understanding, culminating in the work undertaken in the recent EU FLEXINET project, to develop a comprehensive manufacturing reference ontology that can (a) support the clarification of understanding across domains, (b) support the ability to flexibly share information across interacting software systems and (c) provide the ability to readily configure company knowledge bases to support interoperable manufacturing systems.},

focused on the strategic and tactical levels of business decision-making most of the concepts and relations within the reference ontology occur at a high generic level.

Level 4 contains 110 properties and 190 relations specialised to the manufacturing business systems domain. The FLEXINET ontology is focused on strategic and tactical decision support for new business opportunities. It has
been used successfully by our industrial partners and with our software partners as a basis for knowledge capture, use and sharing. Importantly this has been successful across the three industrial sectors involved in the project.

It is based on the postulate that an ontological model of a product may be considered as a facilitator for interoperating all application software that share information during the physical product lifecycle. The number of applications involved in manufacturing enterprises may in fact refer to the knowledge that must be embedded in it, appropriately storing all its technical data based on a common model. Standardisation initiatives (ISO and IEC) try to answer the problem of managing heterogeneous information scattered within organizations, by formalising the knowledge related to product technical data. The matter of this approach is to formalise all those technical data and concepts contributing to the definition of a Product Ontology, embedded into the product itself and making it interoperable with applications, thus minimising loss of semantics},

Especially, the lack of interoperability between product data management (PDM) systems, that drive virtual product development, and enterprise resource planning (ERP), which manages real product, cannot lead to a global description of the product development process. We demonstrate that a mediator approach is pertinent for the coordination of these two systems. The use of open standards, and more precisely STEP Application Protocol 239, known as product lifecycle support (PLCS), allows overcoming issues related to semantic part of this interoperability.

During the design process, they must use a variety of Computer Aided Design (CAD) softwares and connect all the Product Data Management (PDM) systems of their customers. After defining the specific needs of these companies, we show that the available commercial CAD/PDM integrations, as well as the current literature, are inappropriate for a multiCAD/multiPDM collaborative design. We first define the few simple processes required to ensure an efficient collaboration. Then, the instantiation of these processes in our CAD/PDM integration can be split into four points: the general definition of a CAD product structure tree and its associated model, the conversion algorithm of the product structure to an Engineering Bill of Material (EBOM), the creation of an Unified Modelling Language (UML) data model, an implementation based upon Component Object Model (COM) and Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) technologies. We conclude by presenting the results obtained from the demonstrator developed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Thus, design outcomes of each expert field have to be put together without affecting the global design integrity. Typical enterprise application integration solutions propose dedicated tools which allow the coupling between engineering software by mapping data representation from one tool to another.

abstract = {Traceability plays an important role in the food industry because it is directly connected with food quality and safety. Safety, in fact, can only be guaranteed by following food products along the entire supply chain. In the last years, a series of food safety scandals have invested the meat sector, highlighting the lack of common standards for information encoding and management and the inability to link food products with the elements involved in their transformation process. This paper describes the MEat Supply Chain Ontology (MESCO), an ontology developed for supporting the management of meat traceability along the whole supply chain. In particular, in this paper the authors instantiate MESCO to take the problem of meat traceability from the farmer to the final consumer. The article describes the main features of MESCO, illustrating the different steps followed for its development and some example of application. MESCO has been validated and interrogated through the formulation of several queries expressed in Description Logic (DL), executed using the Pellet reasoner, to deal with different scenarios and problems of traceability. The results show that MESCO is able to represent all the knowledge and information related to the meat traceability domain into a single ontology, enabling interoperability among different systems and allowing for integrating the heterogeneous databases adopted by each actor involved in the supply chain. One of the main advantages in using MESCO is the facility in obtaining essential data, fundamental in case of food outbreak disease, addressing the key issues that makes the job of food safety agents frustrating.},

Data is generally stored in local da-tabases that impose several restrictions to ensure effi cient infor-mation access and management and hinder the interoperability between different systems. Furthermore, databases are often not completely suitable, as these applications demand a more semantic approach to provide an“enriched” meaning. Highly expressive systems and techniques are therefore required. These systems must be characterized by the ability to exchange relevant data between competent authorities in a timely, meaningful, coherent and auditable manner

abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) address different business needs for manufacturers. There are several factors to be considered when integrating PLM and ERP which cover many different areas such as organization and cultural, business practice and technology factors. There are various approaches that a company can take to accomplish integration between PLM and ERP. Each approach will provide differing levels and complexity of integration, functionality, scope, and cost of implementation and support. Companies need to assess the issues described previously and select the best approach based on their specific needs, future plans, current infrastructure, and estimated cost. In this context, the data to be exchanged between PLM and ERP is identified and these data have to be communicated to the ERP from PLM. Data related to the manufacturing system should be stored and managed into PLM system. Also, the interaction frequency among PLM and ERP varies depending on the degree of product customization and needs to be addressed for integration. The main objective of the present work is to develop a framework for PLM and ERP integration module, based on ontologies, which resolves syntactic and semantic data conflicts. The proposed model would help in the optimization of enterprise systems, business processes and product development systems by the integration of complimentary desktop productivity applications, heterogeneous Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems, enterprise systems and Product Data Management (PDM) databases.},

The sharing of manufacturing process information among different functional application systems, such as process planning, manufacturing simulation, manufacturing execution and project management, has become difficult to implement due to the growing complexity of the manufacturing information of product, process, resource and plant. A unified representation of manufacturing process information for all applications can enable convenient integration between different application systems. The development of manufacturing-related ontology and the Process Specification Language (PSL) has provided a formal definition and structure of semantic concepts for the capture and the exchange of manufacturing information.

Automation in Business to-Business (B2B) Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) scenarios confronts challenges related to the resolution of data heterogeneities, service discovery and process composition that should be integrated under a secure framework. In this paper, we propose the Secure Enterprise Interoperability Ontology (SENIO) that provides a secure, shared, common understanding of data, services and processes within B2B integration scenarios. SENIO is based on security-related ontologies that are designed to describe security properties of web services, which can be specific, by stating the particular standards/protocols supported, or more general, such as the security mechanisms used and the credentials required. The security properties associated with registered web services as well as requests for web services are security requirements and capabilities. Finally, we present the utilization of SENIO in a real-world B2B scenario, which describes a network of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) cooperating with each other in order to provide secure human resource services.},

For example, semantic models are used as knowledge bases that encapsulate different type of information of manufacturing systems, e.g., statuses and capabilities of their cyber and physical resources. Moreover, these models can be updated and accessed during runtime. In this context, models are becoming a critical part of the system infrastructure for both controlling and monitoring activities. However, models tend to be designed for specific purposes and not standardized. This is an issue because the employed formalisms, such as ontologies, emerged in order to bring an engineering tool for commonly classifying, defining, and sharing information. This article proposes the development of modular ontologies based on different parts of the ISA-95 standard for describing the product, process, and resource information of manufacturing systems.

However, the communication of digital models comes with challenges. The information resides in various systems and applications, in different formats and with various levels of detail and viewpoints. This makes the communication and sharing of information among different actors and application, challenging. To deal with the data exchange and integration problem, the information standards ISO 10303 (STEP) has shown a strong capability to represent rich information models in a wide variety of industrial domains for the purpose of exchanging data. On the other hand, the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative provides a minimalistic set of standardized information models, focusing on the most common concepts within a particular domain. Assuming a loosely-coupled distributed architecture of tools and services, OSLC adopts the Linked Data (LD) approach to ensure data consistency across the data resources. How can we combine STEP's rich information model for data exchange, with OSLC's minimalistic approach for data integration The aim of this work is to show the applicability of using these two complementary paradigms-and their corresponding standards to support interoperability and data integration in a heterogeneous IT environment for material flow analysis and layout design.},

In this article, an enlarged data representation called semantic information layer (SIL) is described for facilitating heterogeneous systems interoperable. SIL plays a role as mediation media and knowledge representation among heterogeneous systems. The SIL building process is based on ontology engineering, including ontology extraction from relational database (RDB), ontology enrichment and ontology alignment. Mapping path will maintain the links between SIL and data source, and query implementation and user interface are for retrieving data and interacting with end users. We described fully a practical ontology-driven framework for building SIL and introduced extensively relevant standards and techniques for implementing the framework.

abstract = {The need for integrating business and technical information systems, allowing partners to collaborate effectively in creating innovative products, has motivated the design and deployment of a novel integration framework for product lifecycle management. The time is ripe for such an integration framework because of the convergence of three important developments, almost in a perfect storm: (1) maturity of standardized product data and meta-data models, and standardized engineering and business processes; (2) emergence of service-oriented architecture for information sharing; and (3) availability of robust middleware to implement them. These developments allow engineering and business objects and processes to be built or composed as modular pieces of software in the form of services that can communicate with each other and be used across different parts of a business. These modular software pieces can be reused and reconfigured in new ways as business conditions change, thereby saving time and money for companies. This paper describes the business and technical aspects of an integration framework for product lifecycle management using open standards and service-oriented architecture. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The semantic interoperability of information has become increasingly important in Product Development Process (PDP) to support different phases during the product development. This article presents a proposal of an Interoperable Product Design and Manufacturing System (IPDMS) concept based on a set of engineering domain ontologies and sematic mapping approaches. The concept explores the potentials of semantic well-defined core-foundations in a Semantic Web ontology language. The formal core-foundations can be specialised to perform application view in Product or Manufacturing Model. The application view is used to support the information sharing between product design and manufacturing and verify the accordance with product requirements. A preliminary experimental has been realised, using a test case to share information from the design to manufacturing of an injection moulding plastic. As results, it was identified potential benefits and limitations. The mains contributions are: semantic interoperability during information sharing in PDP and analysis of inconsistencies in PDP. {\textcopyright} IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.},

abstract = {Global competitiveness has challenged manufacturing industry to rationalize different ways of bringing to the market new products in a short lead-time with competitive prices, high quality, and customization. Modern Product Development Process (PDP) has been requiring simultaneously collaboration of multiple groups, exchanging information from multiple perspectives within and across enterprise boundaries. However, semantic interoperability issues (misinterpretation and mistakes) in view of the information heterogeneity from multiple perspectives and their relationships. This research proposes a semantic reconciliation view to support the interoperable information relationships in product design and manufacturing. This view is part of the conceptual framework of an Interoperable Product Design and Manufacturing System (IPDMS). The semantic reconciliation method uses three approaches (Adjustment Context, Ontology Intersection, and Semantic Alignment) to provide support for the semantic information relationships across the product design and manufacturing. The method is applied in a rotational thin-wall plastic injected design and manufacturing and evaluated through the development of semantic rules responsible for the information mapping of sharing, conversion and translation. This semantic rules were modeled in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) supported by Web Ontology Languages (OWL). Sequentially, the potential benefits and limitation of the method was discussed, contributing to the semantic information interoperability during the development of complex products.},

Industries need to effectively share heterogeneous information during Product Development Process (PDP) within and across their institutional boundaries to be competitive.

Thus, this research proposes a systematic literature review to identify the main researches and the milestones reference works on semantic interoperability field. A rigorous methodology was conducted in different databases, covering the articles published in scientific journals from 2005 to 2015 as a preliminary study had indicated that the incidence of articles related to the subject was more frequent from the second half of the 2000s. The research structure consisted of four steps: Survey – searching, analysis and selection of recent researches; Categorisation – categorisation of the selected papers; References citation frequency analysis – the selected papers were analysed and the main researches and milestones references were identified; and Main researches critical analysis – the main researches were analysed for their contributions and limitations, their contributions and limitations, resulting in 14 selected scientific articles and 8 identified milestones references. It is evident that this field has interesting perspectives on future research opportunities on semantic interoperability of information issues across PDP, contributing to the new concepts of future factories.},

After motivating their need, we clarify just what ontologies are and what purpose they serve. We outline a methodology for developing and evaluating ontologies, first discussing informal techniques, concerning such issues as scoping, handling ambiguity, reaching agreement and producing definitions. We then consider the benefits and describe, a more formal approach. We re-visit the scoping phase, and discuss the role of formal languages and techniques in the specification, implementation and evalution of ontologies.

The proposed idea shows the development of a MFO in several layers and various levels in those layers. The foundation ontology will act as a basis for building Interoperable knowledge bases or 'World Models' from a library of formally defined concepts in a heavy weight ontology. MFO must be flexible enough to allow organizations to be able to model their own domains with the flexibility to use the terms they want. Rules and axioms governing each and every concept add rigour to the semantics of the MFO and restrict the use of concepts to facilitate interoperability with a minimum effect on flexibility to model.},

abstract = {Due to the advancement in the application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), manufacturing industry and its many domains employ a wide range of different ICT tools. To be competitive, industries need to communicate effectively within and across their many system domains. This communication is hindered by the diversity in the semantics of concepts and information structures of these different domain systems. Whilst international standards provide an effective route to information sharing within narrowly specified domains, they are themselves not interoperable across the wide range of application domains needed to support manufacturing industry due to the inconsistency of concept semantics. Formal ontologies have shown promise in removing interpretation problems by computationally capturing the semantics of concepts, ensuring their consistency and thus providing a verifiable and shared understanding across multiple domains. The research work reported in this paper contributes to the development of formal reference ontology for manufacturing, which is envisaged as a key component in future interoperable manufacturing systems. A set of core manufacturing concepts are identified and their semantics have been captured in formal logic based on exploiting and extending existing standards definitions, where possible combined with an industrial investigation of the concepts required. A successful experimental investigation has been conducted to verify the application of the ontology based on the interaction between concepts in the design and manufacturing domains of an aerospace component. {\textcopyright} 152013 {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Software systems have become increasingly complex, and they are often formed by integrating independent systems, resulting in a new class of systems referenced as System of Systems (SoS). The System of Systems Integration (SoSI) emerges as a new challenge and aims to create a new feature by integrating constituent systems that contribute to the overall goal of the SoS. Often the constituent systems tend to be from different sources and behaviors and, as such, tend to employ different terminology and concepts. Also, when SoSI involves the integration of legacy systems, cases where the documentation and the necessary skills for the harmonious integration are readily available are very rare. However, it is observed that there is a lack of studies that are comprehensive and, at the same time, contain a detailed view of how the constituent systems are integrated in order to collectively achieve a common goal. Based on this scenario, the main contribution of this systematic review (SR) is to investigate the state of the art of SoSI and the software engineering methods that assist in the integration between constituent systems of a SoS. The SR has found 1398 studies and, at the end of the selection process, we selected 29 studies for data extraction. Most studies describe individuals and teams who have worked in isolation to develop solutions to certain problems without widespread adoption of a form of integration. Thus, there is a growing concern of researchers in the SoS context. However, it still lacks research and greater dissemination of concepts among researchers in the field. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

Evidently, any production related information exchanged in the network must be vertically forwarded to the corresponding service endpoints of the local production system. Accordingly, there is a need to align information that flows between companies and within each company. The Resource-Event-Agent (REA) business ontology describes a metamodel for internal business activities (e.g., production) and for inter-organizational exchange constellations on the enterprise resource planning (ERP) level. ISA-95 is a series of standards targeting the integration of enterprise control systems on the interface between ERP systems and manufacturing execution systems. Consequently, we align elements of REA and ISA-95 and define conversion rules for the transformation of elements from one system to the other. By interleaving the semantics of both standards, we formally strengthen the links between the services of the business level and the production level, and support multi-system adaptation in flexible production environments. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

An energy demand model based on STEP-NC is established and the problem to be solved is stated, including optimisation objectives and constraints. The developed ontology consists of OntoSTEP-NC extended to provide energy demand information support and rules to generate preliminary machining schemes (PMSs). Ant colony optimisation (ACO) is used to select the best machining scheme from the PMSs. The above two parts, namely ontology and ACO, constitute the hybrid approach presented in this study, which is implemented by developing a prototype. Finally, a test example is given to validate the proposed approach and the result shows that it can be employed to achieve energy-efficient machining of milled components. {\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {AFR has long been realized as a key technology for design automation. A significant shortcoming in AFR is that most of them are individual systems that are isolated from each other, due to the absence of a standard feature library or feature modeling techniques. Few studies attempted to overcome this problem by allowing a certain degree of user customization or extension, which are still far from success. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes an ontology-based feature recognition framework. In the framework, features are captured transparently and hierarchically within a formal OWL ontology, and the feature recognition is achieved by applying an efficient backward-chained ontology reasoner to reason through the ontology. The resulting feature recognition system shows a high level of flexibility, maintainability, and explainability, for both representing and recognizing features. The effectiveness of the framework is finally demonstrated with three case studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

A myriad of standards pertaining to various aspects of a product's life cycle exist; however, it is often difficult for non-experts to navigate and comprehend these standards. The objective of this paper is to describe a classification system for capturing the requirements, concepts and terminology from those standards at the intersection of life cycle and manufacturing process domains. The classification is implemented as an ontology using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We then use an ontology visualization tool we have developed, to help users navigate and understand the information in these standards more easily. Such an ontology can support life cycle assessment activities or sustainability decision-making in the life cycle stages, such as replacing energy consuming processes and equipment with sustainable practices. In addition, the ontology can support the development of new life cycle and manufacturing standards. The ontology provides a holistic picture of the requirements to enrich comprehension of and compliance to the growing number of sustainable manufacturing standards.},

abstract = {Producing a bill of quantity is a knowledge-based, dynamic and collaborative process, and evolves with variances and current evidence. However, within the context of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a bill of quantity that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the bill of quantity to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, ‘cost items' signify the elements included in a bill of quantity, including details of their description, quantity and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain user.},

abstract = {Effective and efficient development of product configuration systems, including the modeling of product configuration knowledge and the development of inference systems, is a key successful factor to implement mass customization paradigm. Ontology-based method for knowledge representation offers a means for the reuse and sharing of knowledge unambiguously. In this paper, we present a way of representing product configuration knowledge using semantic web technology, namely OWL and SWRL, and developing actual configuration engines based on derived configuration knowledge. Firstly, a general configuration ontology model defining vocabularies, terminologies and relationships that are common to the product configuration domain is constructed to act as a general semantic foundation for product configuration. With this general model, domain specific configuration models can be derived by inheriting or subclassing the ontologies within this general model. Both general ontology-based model and domain specific configuration model are formalized using OWL, an ontology language for encoding knowledge over the Web. Furthermore, constraint knowledge, such as require constraints and resource constraints, is represented with SWRL, a rule language based on OWL. Finally, actual configuration system is implemented using JESS by mapping OWL-based configuration knowledge and SWRL-based constraints into Jess facts and Jess, respectively. The presented ontology-based method for representing configuration knowledge enables the reuse of product configuration knowledge and thus facilitates the processes of modeling product configuration knowledge. In addition, the implementation of actual configuration system with existing rule engine, namely JESS, makes it possible the rapid development of product configuration systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, an approach to modeling product configuration
models and to developing product configurators is presented through the use of Semantic Web technique, an emerging research area in the recent several years. Configuration models are classified into General Configuration Models and Domain-specific Configura- tion models, which are derived by subclassing the concepts or rela- tionships in the General Configuration model. By this way, configuration knowledge can be reused as much as possible. Both configuration models are represented in OWL, a standard ontology language for describing knowledge over Web. Due to the fact that OWL is based on Description Logics, Configuration models have well-defined logical semantics, which make it possible to reason about subsumption of concepts and inconsistence of ontologies within configuration knowledge base. Considering configuration constraints, such as require constraints and incompatibility con- straints, often occur in the form of rule type knowledge, configura- tion knowledge bases are extended with rule knowledge that describes constraints in SWRL, a standard rule language based on OWL. By transforming OWL configuration knowledge into JESS facts, and SWRL constraints into JESS rules, actual configuration processes are done through the use of JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform. The presented approach enables the reuse of prod- uct configuration knowledge and thus facilitates the development of product configuration models. In addition, the implementation of actual configuration system with existing rule engine, namely JESS, makes it possible the rapid implementation of product config- uration processes},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Springer-Verlag London Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is emerging as a promising manufacturing paradigm, which can realize and provide distributed and heterogeneous manufacturing resources as services for all phases of the product lifecycle. A task-driven manufacturing cloud service (MCS) proactive discovery and optimal configuration method is presented in this paper to realize full-scale sharing, on-demand use, and collaborative configuration of manufacturing resources in CMfg. In this research, two kinds of resources, including manufacturing machine and manufacturing cell (MC), are viewed as a breakthrough point of the investigation of multi-granularity resource configuration process. During resource modeling, advanced information and sensor technologies are adopted to construct the information models of resources, which consist of static attributes, real-time manufacturing data, and evaluation information. It makes the traditional production process more transparent, traceable, and on-line controllable. By applying the service proactive discovery mechanism, service providers rapidly respond to task requirements on the basis of real-time status and submit requests to perform tasks proactively. Hence, the responsiveness and initiative of service providers are highly enhanced. Consequently, the efficient discovery of potential services can be achieved. In service configuration process, a scientific evaluation system is established to perform the comprehensive assessment of services. Then, through the evaluation method based on grey relational analysis (GRA), the service optimal configuration is implemented. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed models and methods is validated by a case study.},

@article{Zhu2015,
abstract = {Disassembly, as one of the core steps in the end of life (EOL) activities, has been a popular topic both in industrial and academic areas. Unlike assembly, any practical disassembly process planning, which is very important for material recycling or component reuse, is still a topic of active research. One major obstacle in developing an optimal disassembly process planning system is the uncertain characteristics of the EOL products (uncertain information), such as the quality and quantity of the components and parts, which normally make a deterministic disassembly process planning impossible. How to represent and further use such uncertain information in reasoning about a realistic optimal disassembly process sequence are the most important research issues. This paper addresses these issues by developing a disassembly information framework which consists of both an ontology-based information model (domain semantics and rules) and a computational model (process planning generation methodology). The explicit domain concepts, relationships, or rules developed in the ontology-based information enhance the process planning generation methodology (computational model) and thus make the planning process efficient and more realistic. Examples are used in the end to illustrate the use of the proposed framework and methodology.},
